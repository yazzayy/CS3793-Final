# CS3793-Final

# Traffic light detection using tensorflow
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher with [OpenCV installed](https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-set-up-anaconda-for-windows-10/)
- You have [TensorFlow 2 Installed](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
  - Windows 10 Users, see [this post](https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-2-on-windows-10/).
  - If you want to use GPU support for your TensorFlow installation, you will need to follow [these steps](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu). If you have trouble following those steps, you can follow [these steps](https://automaticaddison.com/real-time-object-recognition-using-a-webcam-and-deep-learning/#install_tf_gpu) (note that the steps change quite frequently, but the overall process remains relatively the same).
-[This post](https://automaticaddison.com/predict-vehicle-fuel-economy-using-a-deep-neural-network/) can also help you get your system setup, including your virtual environment in Anaconda (if you decide to go this route).
[This tutorial is not a prerequisite](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), but it is one of the best tutorials on the Internet for the step-by-step process of how to detect objects in an image or a video using Tensorflow 2.
